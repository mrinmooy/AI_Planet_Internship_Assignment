## How to run:
Assuming you already have an up-to-date g++ compiler installed on your system, here's a quickstart guide to execute this program.  
For a more detailed description on how to build and run this program see [here](https://github.com/mrinmooy/AI_Planet_Internship_Assignment/blob/master/documentation/how_to_build_and_run.pdf).
### Step 1: Download
Either clone this repository, or download the zip file and extract the source code files on youre system.
### Step 2: Navigate
Open command line terminal in that folder, or navigate to that folder which contains the source code files through terminal itself.
### Step 3: Compile & Execute
Run the following commands
```
g++ -std=c++14 -o assignment main.cpp -lpthread
```
```
./assignment
```
Your program should compile successfully and start executing. It will prompt for user input on the terminal, enter your desired input and you shall receieve the output accordingly on the terminal itself.  

### Sample Inputs

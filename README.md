![alt text](https://github.com/mrinmooy/AI_Planet_Internship_Assignment/blob/master/images/desktop.png?raw=true)
## Description:
This repository includes the documentation and source code files containing the implementation of a multi-threaded message system with the help of queue.
## How to run:
Assuming you already have an up-to-date g++ compiler installed on your system, here's a quickstart guide to execute this program.  
For a more detailed description on how to build and run this program see [here](https://github.com/mrinmooy/AI_Planet_Internship_Assignment/blob/master/documentation/how_to_build_and_run.pdf)
### Step 1 
Either clone this repository or download the zip file and extract the source code files in a folder of your choice.
### Step 2
Open command line terminal in that folder, or navigate to that folder through terminal itself.
### Step 3
Run the following commands
```
g++ -std=c++14 -o assignment main.cpp -lpthread
```
```
./assignment
```
Your program should compile successfully and start execution. It will prompt for user input on the terminal, enter your desired input and you shall receieve the output accordingly on the terminal itself.
